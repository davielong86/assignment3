robot Project


this is the third installment for oop
this time around I have decided to get a robot off Bryan its old and needs alot of work but i like a chalange.
the aim of this is to get the robot working to a point that it can either work on its own pre programmed commands using sensors to avoid collisions with anything. i am also goint to try and control it via a web or phone app not sure yet, more details to come on this one.

i am also going to try and put together a simple hame using unity. the reason for this is it is another oop language and i feel the robot is limited to a recon bot at best for the min or at least till i get some robotic arms off Bryan to attach to it.
the unity game is going to coded in C#, the robot is a mix of python as it is going to have a raspberry pi as its brain controling the gpio pin for outputs to motors, there may be some databases like mysql with some php and html if i go the route of a web based app. if i go fro a bluetooth connection to the robot it will be a android app. im leaning more towards the web based approach as this will allow me to control the bot from anywhere as long as there in an internet connection.
